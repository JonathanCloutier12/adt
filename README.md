# DDD and architectural layers kata

You goal is to start from ConsoleMain, and create necessary layers.

Required layers :

 * UI
 * Application service
 * Context
 * Domain
 * Persistence

Make sure you trace the dependencies and that you introduce required abstractions in order to respect DIP and DDD ideas.
